This is a Qt-based program for Windows and Linux to generate tetrahedral meshes for 
finite element simulation from various surface mesh formats. It also offers a fast 
and easy-to-use mesh viewer based on QGLViewer and allows basic mesh manipulations 
(currently only scaling is possible). Two different methods for tetrahedralization 
are possible: Delaunay Triangulation and Johnathan Shewchuk's Isosurface Stuffing algorithm.

As I am using lots of 3rd-party open-source C/C++ libraries, this work is released 
as GPL software. This includes all self-written code. 3rd-party code remains under 
its own license.

Features

    - Runs on Windows and Linux (tested on Win7 (32/64 bit), WinXP (32 bit) and Ubuntu 12.04/12.10).
    - Integration of QGLViewer for easy mesh preview.
    - Surface mesh import and export for *.obj, *.ply, *.off, *.stl (using trimesh2).
    - Import and export of tetrahedral meshes in (a simplified subset of the) GMSH format *.msh 
      (compatible with the SOFA Framework).
    - Two different methods for tetrahedralization: Delaunay Triangulation (CGAL implementation) and 
      Johnathan Shewchuk's Isosurface Stuffing: Fast Tetrahedral Meshes with Good Dihedral Angles 
      (implementation taken from the SOFA Framework, non-graded variant only).
    - Wireframe and solid/shaded drawing.
    - Cutplane view for tetrahedral meshes.
    - Export the surface of a tetrahedral mesh.
    - Automatic parameter guessing for tetrahedralization.
    - Reversible scale mechanism for CGAL performance optimization.
