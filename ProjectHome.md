This is a Qt-based program for Windows and Linux to generate tetrahedral meshes for finite element simulation from various surface mesh formats. It also offers a fast and easy-to-use mesh viewer based on  and allows basic mesh manipulations (currently only scaling is possible).
Two different methods for tetrahedralization are possible: Delaunay Triangulation and Johnathan Shewchuk's Isosurface Stuffing algorithm.

The Google Code project merely exists to simplify sourcecode hosting.
